    Most of us are in a private telegram group that is bridged to an irc channel
    called #svu in Libera chat. You can chat with us by either setting up your 
    own irc client. You can select from a list <a href="https://libera.chat/guides/clients">
    here</a>. Or you can simply chat using your <a href="https://web.libera.chat/#svu">browser.</a>
    The key for the room is "magnificentsteiner". You do not need to provide a password.

    IRC expands to "Internet Relay Chat" which represents a protocol that faciliates 
    communication between users real time. Its an open and decenteralised system 
    that is still used by many people for communication within the open source community
    each other. There are many irc <a href="https://www.mirc.com/servers.html">servers</a> 
    you can connect to and each server has many channels prefixed by a "#" that you can join. 
    Channels  are created based on subjects of interest. There are a few things to know before 
    exploring irc.

        <ul class="bullet list">
            <li>Channels prefixed by a "#" denote official channels and ones with "##" are unoffical</li>
            <li>You can join any public channel but a few of them require invites or keys to enter</li>
            <li>If you have sent a query to a channel patiently wait for the response</li>
            <li>Its best to not directly pm anyone unless they explicitly ask you to</li>
